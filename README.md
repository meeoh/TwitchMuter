# TwitchMuter

Mutes inactive twitch tabs! If you ever have multiple twitch streams open at once in different tabs, but only want the active tab to have audio playing, just activate the extension via the icon in the top right, and voila!

***IMPORTANT***
In order for the extension to work properly as of this version, all twitch tabs MUST be muted before activating the extension!
